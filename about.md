This blog focuses on programming related mistakes or technical problems I have fixed/solved so that anyone having the same specific problems might find a solution here via Google. I also blog inconsistently on machine learning and research related topics at [The NonConditional Beast](http://nonconditional.com).

### About Me
I'm a Ph.D. student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Computer Science. My main research interests are robotics, machine learning, and computer vision. Specifically, my main research focus is on robotic grasping - learning robots to recognize patterns in categories of everyday objects that can be exploited to perform more efficient grasps of the objects that belong to the category.

Before being in Academia I was a master student in Engineering Physics. I did my Master Thesis on image segmentation at TTI (Toyota Technological Institute) in Chicago under supervision of Raquel Urtasun. Prior to that I was at TU Berlin studying machine learning courses under professor Mannfred Opper and professor Klaus-Robert Muller.

And before my engineering studies, at the dawn of time, I was juggling music studies with being a web design freelancer doing stuff like [Bookle](http://www.bookle.se).

My free time nowadays is mostly focused on the common academic pursuit of long distance running and triathlon. Trying to get that Marathon time under 3hrs!
